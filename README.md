# DolphinGuideScanner
This is a small application which allows a single switch user to user [Dolphin Guide](http://yourdolphin.com/product?id=5)

## What it does?
It runs in the system tray and detects a spacebar key. When pressed it starts scanning (Pressing the right key). When pressed again it selects the item

## Why?
Because some people need to use a single switch and have a significant visual impairment. Without this they need to access the keyboard

## What about...
You can two switch scan with Dolphin Guide. Simply connect one switch to Arrow Right key and one key to Enter. But if you want one switch this is your answer.

## Cool. How do I get it?

Download it here and run it. I recommend popping it in your startup items
